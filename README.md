This is the project README file. 
This is a very basic game where you have to shoot down the coming rockets with the laser that keeps shooting out of your plane
automatically and don't let the rockets touch your plane. The game is developed in java platform using Greenfoot IDE.
This project is a simple game dedicated to my childhood, I used to play a game similar to this a lot in my chidhood.
If you remember the nostalgic game you might have played in **Nokia** phones.
